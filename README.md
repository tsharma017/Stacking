# Stacking

1. Overview
Stacking (Stacked Generalization) is an ensemble learning technique that combines predictions from multiple models (base learners) and uses a meta-model (also called a blender or second-level model) to make final predictions.

✅ Key Idea:
Instead of averaging predictions (like bagging or boosting), stacking learns how to best combine different models for improved accuracy.

2. How Stacking Works
Stacking involves two main layers:

🔹 Layer 1: Base Learners (Diverse Models)
Multiple models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) are trained on the same dataset.
Each model makes predictions on the training set.
🔹 Layer 2: Meta-Learner (Final Model)
The predictions from the base models are used as features for another model (meta-model).
The meta-model learns to combine the predictions to make a final decision.


3. Stacking Process (Step-by-Step)
Train Multiple Models (Base Learners)

Train different machine learning models on the training dataset.
Each base model makes predictions.
Generate New Features (Meta-Model Training Data)

The predictions of the base models become the new input features for the meta-model.
Train the Meta-Model

The meta-model (e.g., a logistic regression, XGBoost, or another neural network) learns to combine the base model predictions.
Make Final Predictions

During testing, the base models make predictions, and the meta-model combines them for the final result.


4. Why Use Stacking?
✅ Improves Model Performance – Learns the best way to combine different models.
✅ Handles Model Bias – Different models have different strengths; stacking balances them.
✅ More Flexibility – You can mix different types of models (e.g., tree-based + neural networks).

📌 Downside:
❌ Computationally Expensive – Requires training multiple models.
❌ Risk of Overfitting – If meta-model is too complex, it may memorize patterns instead of generalizing.
